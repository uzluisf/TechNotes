## About

This repo contains notes around techology in knowledge, e.g., computer science, programming, software engineering, etc. I have taken them during my studying as a way to internalize what I've studied and in order to have a place to go back to if I ever want to review that knowledge. There are simply my notes, and don't dictate how anyone should be taking their own notes: I have done what encouraged me to take notes with the least amount of friction. 

It's not my aim to create a corpus of notes that will be useful to anyone else but me. Thus, you might find incomplete notes, notes that make no sense, notes that you wouldn't have taken yourself, notes that are obvious, notes with errors, etc. 

## Installation

All these notes are in Markdown, thus they could be edited with any text editor and rendered with any text editor that supports Markdown. However I am creating them with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a Markdown editor that supports backlinking among notes. Thus, install Obsidian if you want to use these notes at their *full potential*.

## How to Navigate My Notes

My notetaking system is combination of [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/), and [MOC](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6). When I write a note, I seek to avoid the following things:
- **Tags.** I don't tag my notes, aside from using the tags `#fleeting`, `#literature`, and `#permanent` to describe their state described below.
- **Folders.** If I use a folder, it's merely to group things together in order to faciliate access to them, not as a way of categorization. 

My notes go through a three stages process, each of which is described by a tag:
- `#fleeting`. These notes are drafts and snippets from articles/videos that I find interesting. I think of them as *Post-it* notes, regardless of their length. 
- `#literature`. These are polished versions of `#fleeting` notes, where I organize and refine the content by removing unnecesary stuff (to me), backlink to other notes, and highlight words. 
- `#permanent`. At this point, the note represents a single piece of knowledge, oftentimes put into my own words. The aim of each `#permanent` note is to be concise and atomized, i.e., a note shouldn't be discussed a few different topics. This is known as the [principle of atomicity](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic#:~:text=Zettelkasten%20notes%20are%20atomic%20and,idea%20and%20one%20idea%20only.).
